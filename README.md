#Initialization:
Further Development on Project Meridian has been permanently halted owning to new Discord API moderations as well as updated discord.js language. Although popular response, new and strict API guidelines as well as complete overhaul for compatibility with latest discord.js version has pushed Meridian on the verge of development halt.
As a result, this code may not be directly ready-to-use and will need proper renewal.
